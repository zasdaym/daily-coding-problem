Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array. For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86. Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would choose not to take any elements.

Do this in O (n) time.

Follow-up: What if the elements can wrap around? For example, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15, as we choose the numbers 3, 4, and 8 where the 8 is obtained from wrapping around.
